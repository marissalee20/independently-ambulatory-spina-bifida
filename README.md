# About the Project
This repository contains de-identified simulated walking data for 22 barefoot, independently ambulatory individuals with spina bifida and 17 individuals with typical development. It also contains code to generate simulations for each walking trial and code to analyze kinematic and kinetic differences between high-functioning individuals with spina bifida and individuals with typical development. Data and comprehensive simulation results are available with the rest of this repository at SimTK (TODO). The intent of this repository is to accompany our research article.
